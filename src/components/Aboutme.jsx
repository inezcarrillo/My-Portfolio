                Hi there! My name is Inez Carrillo. I am a first generation Mexican American. I currently work in health care in the radiology department, nuclear medician to be exact. I have loved working in health care but know there is much more out there for me. Learning software development has been challenging but very rewarding. I hope to grow and become better everyday.
