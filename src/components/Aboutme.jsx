                Hi there! My name is Inez Carrillo. I am a first generation Mexican American. I currently work in health care in the radiology department, nuclear medicine to be exact. I have loved working in health care but know there is much more out there for me. Learning software development has been challenging but very rewarding. I hope to grow and become better everyday.
                I am a huge family person. Since moving away from home 3 years ago, I still try to maintain a close connection with my family. 
                Some things I love doing on my free time are running 5k, working out, hanging out with friends, going to concerts, and trying new restaurants.
